# Changelog Conventions

**Always update the Changelog.md file in the specific subproject you're modifying to track changes applied to each sub project.**

## Sections and Structure

### WIP Section

- Located at the top of the file after the title
  - Format: `## WIP` followed by bullet point entries
  - This is where all unreleased changes should be documented!

## Entry Guidelines

- Start each entry with a dash `-`
- Group related changes together
- Use backticks for code references: `` `methodName` ``
- Use indentation for sub-details:
  ```
  - New feature X
      - Detail 1
      - Detail 2
  ```

## Entry Categories

- **New features**: Usually warrant a MINOR version bump
- **Bugfixes**: Usually warrant a PATCH version bump
- **Breaking changes**: Usually warrant a MAJOR version bump (mark these clearly)
- **Internal improvements**: Depends on impact

## Best Practices

- Be specific about what changed
- Document regression tests when added
- For API changes, document both old and new behavior
- If an endpoint changed, explicitly mention the old and new endpoint path
- Use consistent terminology
- Keep entries concise but descriptive
- Do not manually add version headers - they are added by the release
